# Dev Diaries for August 2024

## Week of Monday August 5th, 2024

### Start of Week Plans & Reflections

Set a goal of two hours monday-friday to work on The Odin Project. Tracked time in Toggl Track and used built-in pomodoro system integration. Also plugging concepts or things i need to remember into anki app on my MacBook. Anki is used to help me later recall what I am learning. It aids in storing what I am learning into long term memory.

I am concerned about doing too much to start and risking burnout not to mention creating inconsistency when doing this. Better to do less and more often then it is do big bursts and code once or twice a week if at all.

### Work Tracking

- Made it through TOP foundations Intro, prerequsites, Git basics and halfway through HTML foundations.
- Intro and prerequsites largely untracked. Got serious about time tracking once near the end of the prerequsites section.

**Total time tracked this week:** 6h 23m

### End of week reflections:

- Two hours a day gave me enough time to chew on concepts without going into complete overwhelm. I would rather get the info and retain it instead of blitzing for 4-5 hours a day.
- Not using anki much for testing myself, just input. I need to build a daily routine where I am recalling what I am learning that is at risk for being forgotten. I know it works when I use it consistently.

### Start of Week Plans & Reflections

Just getting ready for the family to transition into school routines, so it's light on work this week. Will be ready to move into normal work flow by September 4th when my son is back to school.

In the interim I am easing into 100 Devs bootcamp cohort two coursework. I will run through the content at my own pace while trying to hit similar timeframes where possible. I am putting The Odin Project on the backburner as I think the 100Devs community and what is being planned there can benefit me more in this leg of the journey. Time permitting I would like to run TOP as a supplemental to 100Devs.
