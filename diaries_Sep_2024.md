### End of week reflections:

- Just did some work to get started on the 100 devs material. I am officially starting on Monday September 9th, 2024 with a goal to finish by July 1st, 2025. I have factored in family vacations PD days for the boys at school, and periods of sickness in the house for that timeline.

## Week of Monday September 9th, 2024

### Start of Week Plans & Reflections

This is the start of my 100 devs bootcamp. I aim to be finished by the end of june, 2025. This is the first full week on the back to school schedule in my house. I have already gone through class 1 during the pre-bootcamp period, so I am working on getting the learning how to learn course finished pronto. From there I can move on to class 2 and the shay howe html and css material. That homework is very meaty and time intensive so I am planning my hours to accomdate for that.

### Work Tracking

#### Monday, Sep 9th, 2024

- Completed anki review session
- Completed 3 hours of Learning how to learn course on coursera
- Completed 1 hour of Anki revisions

On a side note, realizing that I should focus on just essentials when adding to Anki. If I try to add everything as I have it will be too time consuming and not a best use of my time. I can't expect to put everything I learn into memory, there's just too much of it. Better to keep the essentials in anki and lean on online resources when I need secondary info. I think parento principle valid here. Mastering the 20% should get me 80% of where I should be. Easy to build on the 80% from there!

**Total time today** is 4h 07m 03s

#### Tuesday, Sep 10th, 2024

- Deleted old check in's on x for 100 dev classes
- Completed 25 min anki review
- Completed 2.5 hours of learning how to learn course. Module 3 complete.
- Reviewed questions for module 3 and added to anki.
- Attended today's 100 devs weekly huddle

##### Notes

My youngest is getting a cold so may be home with me tomorrow. I may be behind schedule even at the start. It's fine, I am accounting for periods with kids home and sick. This is a marathon not a sprint. I will make up the time where I can and accept this won't be a smooth road to the finish line.

**Total time today** is 4h 10m 58s

#### Wednesday, Sep 11th, 2024

- Completed 1.5 hours of Learning how to learn course on coursera. Module 4 complete and course is finished.
- Submitted screenshot of LHTL course completion via 100 devs homework submissions link.
- Added module 4 questions to anki for LHTH course.

##### Notes

My son is home today with a cold as expected. I will do my best to get work done but my ability to deeply focus will be compromised. As previously stated I have budgeted for sick days so if I don't get much done that is ok.

#### Thursday, Sep 12th, 2024

- Completed class 2 video lectures (2h57m)

##### Notes

Back at it full on. Had troubles focusing so really had to lean on Pomodoro's today. I pushed off anki and it never got done. Lesson learned. I will do it first thing tomorrow when I have the most discpline and willpower. Eat that frog!

Got 17 hours in this week. With the family commitments it's better to front load work hours into monday and friday. Weekends are extremely unreliable for hours I can put in. My child being sick has been challenging at times this week but i'm working around it. Good first week back all things considered.
